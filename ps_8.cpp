Odd Sum
You are the class teacher of N students, and are assigning them a task in which they need to find the odd parts of all their roll numbers. The odd parts of the roll numbers can be calculated using the following formula:
r[i]  = ( 2k ) * t (where r is roll number of the ith student, k is the nearest maximum power of 2 less than ith number and t is the odd part of the roll number)
Your task is to find and return an integer value representing the sum of odd parts of the roll numbers of every student in the class.
Note: Return the output modulo 10007.
Input: An integer value N, representing the number of students.
Output: Return an integer value representing the sum of the odd part of the roll number of every student in the class.
Example 1:
Input: 6
Output: 14
Example 2:
Input: 2
Output: 2
Example 3:
Input: 10
Output: 36
